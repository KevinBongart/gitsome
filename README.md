This fork of Matt's [nice and simple oh-my-zsh prompt](https://github.com/mtully/gitsome) uses parenthesis around the git branch instead of brckets around the whole prompt.

It's a super simple prompt with some git:

  1. The current directory
  2. Current git branch name
  3. Git status on the current branch (red/green)

Use [flat-terminal](https://github.com/KevinBongart/flat-terminal) for the full effect.
